# The Pandemic’s Impact on Australian Citizens’ Life Experience in 2020

## Overview of Paper
This report explores the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social experiences and wellbeing of people in Australia. The data is the Australia General Social Survey (GSS) Summary Results downloaded from the Australian Bureau of Statistics portal. Health protocols implemented by the Australian government has caused people to quarantine at home for the majority of their time, with exception for essential activities such as grocery shopping. Restrictions like these have caused a drop in employment rate despite an increase in university degrees obtained in 2020. Health conditions have also surprisingly improved during the pandemic. Through an in-depth analysis, we found underlying causes for these post-COVID changes in the life of Australians.
